### Add an app
Adding a app to the system is simple. Follow the instructions.
1. Put your python script in to the folder `apps`
2. Open `apps.yml` and add your app to the list. Your python script's name need to be same as in the list.
3. For example, if I'm adding `calculator.py` to the `apps` folder, I need to put `calculator` in `apps.yml` list.
   In `apps.yml`:
   ```
   apps:
    - calculator
   ```
   The `calculator` statement needs to be same name as the python script. In this example, it is `calculator.py`
